# Programs contained

- Datagram examples
	- Chat (client & server)
- Stream examples
	- Web page grabber (client only)
	- Hangman (client & server) 

## Chat
Users can send text messages to eachother. One is host and one is client but no difference to the user besides that the host starts it up and the client joins.

## Web page grabber
Grabs raw HTML of a webpage. That is all. Client only.

## Hangman
Two player hangman. Player 1 picks a word and then watches player 2 enter guesses until their stick man is toast (player 1 wins) or they guess the word correctly (player 2 wins). 

Either the host is always player 1 and the client always player 2, or they alternate. In the event that they alternate, some code could be eseparated to be used by both.

# Purpose of this repo

This repo should contain extensively commented and functional code for the basic network applications described above.

It is companion material to the talk I (Alex) will be giving to the Vancouver Island University Computer Science Club (and any other students who come!) on December 8th, 2023.
